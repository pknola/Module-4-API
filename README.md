# Module-4-API
Create a timed quiz that is multiple choice and tracks users high scores on local url storage

Created with the intent of basic templates from challenge, then used ChatGPT, W3 schools and MDN 
to enhance the code with sound effects that I found on zapsplat.
At first, I could not get the sound effects to play so I used the inspect console and Google to assist
Finally, I got the sounds to take place for a right or wrong answer accordingly.  It was a spelling error!

Ready to launch
